# Student Performance Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict student performance based on several academic and lifestyle factors.  
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes features such as study hours, previous scores, sleep hours, extracurricular activities, and practice question papers.

The goal is to understand how multiple variables collectively influence student performance and to evaluate the predictive power of a linear regression model.

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature selection
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using **Multiple Linear Regression**
5. Model evaluation using:
   - R² Score
   - Cross-Validation Score
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
6. Prediction of student performance

## 📈 Model Evaluation
- **R² Score:** Measures how well the independent variables explain the variance in student performance.
- **Cross-Validation:** score means that the model has been evaluated multiple times on different portions of the data, and the score is the average result.
- **RMSE:** Measures the average prediction error in the same units as the target variable.

Lower RMSE and higher R² indicate better model performance.
